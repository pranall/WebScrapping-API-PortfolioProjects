# Job Market Analysis: Data Scientist Roles in India

## Overview

This project analyzes the job market for **Data Scientist** positions in **India** using data scraped from **Naukri.com**. Approximately **12,000 job postings** were collected and examined to understand market demand, job distribution, and skill requirements. The analysis includes both programmatic scraping and visual exploration of the gathered data.

## Data Collection

### Website

**Naukri.com** — one of India’s most widely used job platforms.

### Keyword Used

**“Data Scientist”**
(Additional overlapping roles such as Data Engineer and ML Engineer appear naturally due to Naukri’s search behavior, but the focus remains on Data Scientist roles.)

### Sample Size

**~12,000 job postings** scraped from India-based listings.

### Collection Process

1. Performed web scraping using Python tools, primarily **BeautifulSoup** and **requests**.
2. Extracted structured information from each posting, including:

   * Job Title
   * Company Name
   * Location
   * Job Type
   * Required Skills
3. Cleaned and organized the scraped data.
4. Saved the compiled dataset as **naukriscrappeddata.csv** for analysis and visualization.

## Market Data Visualization

Large datasets benefit from visual summaries to reveal trends, patterns, and role distribution.
Visualizations were created for key elements of the job market, including at least two of the following:

* **Titles of Available Positions**
* **Location Distribution** (including remote roles)
* **Job Type Breakdown** (Full-time or Part-time)
* **Key Skills Required**

Charts such as bar plots, histograms, and pie charts were used to highlight frequency patterns, geographic clustering, and skill relevance. Additional tables were included where graphical representation was not necessary.
